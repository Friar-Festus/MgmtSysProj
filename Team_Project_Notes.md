# Team Project Notes

## Deliverables

### Concept of Operations (CONOPS)

- Loading into Operations Van
- Transport to/from support vessel
- Loading/Unloading Operations Van on/off support vessel
- Mission planning
- Mission execution
  - Load mission parameters into AUV
  - Launch AUV from support vessel
  - Perform mission
  - Recover AUV
  - Transfer mission data from AUV
  - Post process and/or transmit mission data
- Post-mission maintenance
  - Freshwater washdown
  - Recharge AUV
